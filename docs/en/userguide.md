# Content Creator User Guide

## Introduction

The Content Creator module provides a simple way to generate content for your pages in the Silverstripe CMS using AI. This document will guide you through using the module to generate content for your pages.

## Generating Content

1. Go to the Pages section in the Silverstripe CMS.
2. Create a new page or edit an existing page.
3. On the page edit screen, click the "AI Content" button (indicated by a rocket icon).
4. Enter a prompt describing the content you want to generate.
5. Click the "Generate Content" button.
6. Review the generated content.
7. Click "Apply Content to Page" to add the content to your page.
8. Save the page to publish the changes.

## Tips for Writing Effective Prompts

To get the best results from the AI content generator, try these tips:

1. **Be specific**: The more specific your prompt, the better the results. For example, instead of "Write about our company," try "Write about our software development company that specializes in healthcare applications and has been in business for 10 years."

2. **Include tone and style**: Specify the tone and style you want for your content. For example, "Write a professional and informative about page for our law firm."

3. **Specify the audience**: Mention who the content is for. For example, "Write a product description for our new fitness app targeted at beginners in their 30s."

4. **Request a specific structure**: If you need a specific structure, mention it in your prompt. For example, "Create a FAQ section with 5 questions and answers about our delivery policy."

## Understanding the Generated Content

The Content Creator will generate content based on the available fields in your page. This might include:

- Page title
- Content
- Custom fields specific to your page type
- Elemental blocks if your page uses them

The content will be structured to match the fields available on your page.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the Content Creator, try the following:

1. **Refresh the page**: Sometimes a simple refresh can fix issues with the modal not appearing or content not generating.

2. **Check your connection**: The content generation requires an internet connection to communicate with the AI service.

3. **Try a different prompt**: If the generated content isn't what you expected, try refining your prompt to be more specific.

4. **Contact your administrator**: If you continue to have problems, contact your site administrator who can check the server logs for any errors.

## Feedback

We welcome feedback on the Content Creator module. If you have suggestions for improvements or feature requests, please contact your site administrator.
